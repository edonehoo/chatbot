Virtual assistant lives in its own package [`@patternfly/virtual-assistant`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/virtual-assistant) 

# Virtual assistant

The Virtual Assistant extension provides UI components for building a virtual assistant layout, leveraging the design system foundations of PatternFly. These components are React-based and contain no additional logic. 

You can take advantage of either the default appearance provided or make advanced customizations through the component's API to make the virtual assistant meet your specific needs.



## Getting started

"dependencies": {
    "@patternfly/patternfly": "^5.3.1",
    "@patternfly/react-core": "^5.3.4",
    "@patternfly/react-styles": "^5.3.1",
    "@patternfly/virtual-assistant": "1.0.0-prerelease.9",
},
```
